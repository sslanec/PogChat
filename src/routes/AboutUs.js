        PogChat was made by Sean and Zoey, a soon-to-be-married couple living in
        Ontario, Canada. We’ve both grown up with the internet from the days of
        GeoCities, Coke Music, and five-star ratings on YouTube. Now, we are
        avid Twitch viewers, often having streams on in the background while
        reading or playing games.

        While we often watch music streamers on our TV, we found the experience
        of being a part of the chat… less than ideal. We used the official
        Twitch mobile app that would still cover a large part of the screen with
        UI when in “chat only mode” and did not support BetterTwitchTV emotes.
        We wanted to make a better chat experience for ourselves. We also saw
        others online mention having similar experiences watching on the TV and
        chatting on the Twitch app on their phones, so we figured we would make
        it available for anyone to use. If it helps us, why not see if others
        might like it too?

      <Text paddingTop={2}>
        So, we created PogChat, a web-based Twitch chat alternative to be part
        of the communities we love. We made PogChat to show more of the chat on
        the screen and support BTTV emotes to read the hype better. Sean has
        been working on this project for months, going through different
        documentation and ensuring all the code works together.

        We hope to support more events like polls and predictions in the future
        and make PogChat a service streamers and chat moderators would want to
        use with different customization options. We look forward to adding more
        as our users grow, so please visit again soon!
